# Encryption and Decryption Program

This Python program allows you to encrypt and decrypt messages using a key-based character shuffling technique. It uses the `random` module for shuffling characters and includes a variety of characters from different character classes such as letters, digits, and punctuation.

## Prerequisites

Before running the program, ensure you have Python installed on your computer. This code is compatible with Python 3.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository to your local machine or download the source code.

2. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory containing the code.

3. Run the program by executing the following command:

```bash
python encryption_decryption.py
```

4. Follow the on-screen prompts:

- Enter a key (integer) for the randomization process.
- Enter the message you want to encrypt or decrypt.
- Choose whether to encrypt (1) or decrypt (2) the message.

5. The program will display the encrypted or decrypted message based on your choice.

## Example

Here's an example of how to use the program:
```
$ python encryption_decryption.py
Enter key: 123
Enter message: Hello, World!
Input (1) to encrypt and (2) to decrypt: 1
Encrypted message: )p&&^B!7*=uq

$ python encryption_decryption.py
Enter key: 123
Enter message: )p&&^B!7*=uq
Input (1) to encrypt and (2) to decrypt: 2
Decrypted message: Hello, World!
```
